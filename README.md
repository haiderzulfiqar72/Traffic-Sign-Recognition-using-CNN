# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-CNN
This project aims to develop a robust CNN for traffic sign recognition using an extended GTSRB dataset with two classes. The CNN consists of two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and binary cross-entropy loss.
